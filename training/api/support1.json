All you have to do, is log in to our cloud solution to use the various features offered by Biz4x. As such, Biz4x is far cheaper than other installable software that offer FX rates because there are no hidden costs that arise from installation errors and other overheads. As your business grows, the cost of maintaining and upgrading the systems in multiple branches will too. With Biz4x, we are able to keep the cost of our solution low because any upgrades to the solution will be done on our end without expensive maintenance being paid by you. This means that you can rapidly grow your business without paying for installation, maintenance, troubleshooting and even hardware."

Since Biz4x is a SaaS solution, it means that it is hosted in the cloud, and any product upgrades are done on our end causing no inconvenience to the user. All you have to do with each software upgrade is to log in and we will guide you through new features with a virtual tour. It is that simple."
