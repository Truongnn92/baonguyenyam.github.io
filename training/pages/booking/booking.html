An exchange rate has two components, the domestic currency and a foreign currency, that can be quoted either directly or indirectly. In a direct quotation, the price of a unit of foreign currency is expressed in terms of the domestic currency, whereas in an indirect quotation, the price of a unit of domestic currency is expressed in terms of the foreign currency. In the case of money changers, the buy rates and sell rates, are quoted against the domestic rates (the base currency), based on the country they are operating in.</div>
