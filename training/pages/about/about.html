        <h2 class="md-display-1">The Solution for All Money Changer Needs.</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-muted mrt-xs-1r">In the past, traditional money changer business owners would record transactions in ledgers or spreadsheets to manage their accounting, and keep track of the amount and type of currencies in stock. Inevitably, errors make it into the records, and expanding the business becomes tricky if other employees do not keep the same detailed records as the owner. Worse, if the business is audited, proving that the business has done its due diligence on customer background checks and kept accurate records of high value transactions could become an unnecessarily complex and messy affair.</p>
